Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I made a player and a game class. The methods in the contract class really made me think of a video game, specificalluy minecraft so i wanted to emulate that. I implemented the contract class (interface) in the game class and used each method to make a little video game. In the player class, it represents the player, the blueprint of a player, and all the actions the player would do. Many of the methods within the game class calls methods in the player class. I envision my little player walking around, flying, and interacting with a bunch of objects.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
In game.java (the class that implements the contract interface) I did not add any additional methods, however in player.java where the player is built I added getSize(), getHealth(), getHands(), putInLeftHand(), putInRightHand(), takeOutOfLeftHand(), takeOutOfRightHand(), addHealth(), reduceHealth(), changeSize(), getWant(), changeWant(), playWithItem(), getCanFly(), getCanWalk(), walk(), and fly(). All of these methods are called and used in game.java however they represent the back end of how the methods implemented work. I created a put all of these in a/the player class because a video gamr requires a player and all of the methods represent actions that would be completed by a player, however are run in the video game.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was easy and hard at the same time. I knew what I wanted to do and knew I thought of a video game, however wuthout instructions and guidance it was a little bit hard. However, once I got going I kinda was able to put it all together.
